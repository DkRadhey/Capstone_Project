Explainable AI for Financial Fraud Detection
This project focuses on building an AI-driven financial fraud detection system using XGBoost for classification and applying Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.

Key Features:

Processed and scaled the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

Trained a high-accuracy XGBoost model for fraud classification.

Applied SHAP for global feature importance analysis.

Applied LIME for local, instance-level fraud explanation.

Visualized fraud explanations using summary plots, waterfall plots, and local feature contributions.

Ensured model transparency to meet regulatory and ethical standards.

Tools Used:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

SHAP, LIME, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Purpose: This project aims to combine high predictive performance with human-understandable explanations, making fraud detection models more trustworthy, regulatory-compliant, and actionable for financial institutions.
